0.4, 4/6/2016: Update to readme

Summary:
--------

This repository contains multiple, sample Bash scripts.  These are 
simple scripts that may be used as examples for writing Bash/Shell programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Shell scripts, some based on Shell examples and stackoverflow....

Note, to edit with Emacs, "esc-x-shell-mode" to get shell mode!

    serve as examples of some features.

5.  After running the scripts, run cleanup.sh to remove test files.

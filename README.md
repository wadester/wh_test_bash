Summary:
--------

This repository contains multiple, sample shell scripts.  These are 
simple scripts that may be used as examples for writing Bash/Busybox
Shell programs.  

This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Shell scripts, some based on Shell examples and stackoverflow....

Note, to edit with Emacs, "esc-x-shell-mode" to get shell mode!

Notes:

1.  This document is in AsciiDoc format following my Minidoc standard
    which is similar to the legacy Minidoc format I have used since the 1990s.

2.  This project is mainly to experiment with Bash scripts and to 
    serve as examples of some features.

3.  License for ALL files is GPL, see LICENSE.

4.  Please e-mail me with any updates, suggestions, etc.  

5.  After running the scripts, run cleanup.sh to remove test files.

6.  This has been expanded to include a few busybox-compatible scripts.

WH Test Bash Repository -- Bash test files

Summary:
========

This is a simple repository with multiple sample Bash scripts.  These are 
simple scripts that may be used as examples for writing Bash/Shell programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Shell scripts, some based on Shell examples and stackoverflow....

Note to edit with Emacs, "esc-x-shell-mode" to get shell mode!
